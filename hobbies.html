                <h2>Weight Training</h2>
                <p>I recently discovered a hobby that has since become a lifestyle. In the summer of 2013, I began weight-training on a semi-regular basis. But soon after, the hobby became a sport to me.The more I went, the more I wanted to go. Gym life has now become my life: weightlifting, cardio, counting calories and macros. I hope to further my interest, knowledge and presence in this sport and sometime in the future, participate in a figure competition. </p>

                <p>Ever since I discovered my love and talent for writing, I have been fascinated with the world of journalism and reporting. I am intrigued with the idea of doing something that I love, along with disseminating information for the public through my work. As I have furthered my education in the field, I have also discovered an interest in the way that the information is distributed, and how it connects people all over the world. I have a dream of acquiring my Master of Arts in Mass Communication while studying abroad, and majoring in Telecommunication at the University of Florida has given me a solid foundation in pursuing this dream and extending my education in the field.
