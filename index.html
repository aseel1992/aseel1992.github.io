                <p>My name is Aseel Alhomsi and I am a fourth year Telecommunication student at the <a href= "http://www.ufl.edu">University of Florida</a>. I was born in Amman, Jordan and I immigrated to the United States at the age of seven. I lived in Tampa, Florida for ten years before moving to Gainesville to attend UF.  </p>
                
                <p>After I learned to speak English fluently, I found that I had a talent; one that I may never have discovered had I not moved to America: writing. This made me become interested in Journalism, and I decided to major in this when I began at <a href="http://www.sfcollege.edu">Santa Fe College</a>. After transferring to the University of Florida, I discovered a broader track in the College of Journalism called Telecommunication - Media and Society. This track focuses on both the production and means of communication as well as the writing aspect of Journalism. </p>
                
                <p>Throughout my time as a college student, I have gained many experiences that have taught me life lessons to carry for the rest of my life. One of the most important things that I have learned as I have matured is to always follow my heart and overcome any obstacles that try to keep me from achieving my goals. I am a firm believer in the idea that nothing easy in life is worth it, and nothing worth it is easy. </p>
