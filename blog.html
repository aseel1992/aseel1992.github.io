            <p>Being a Telecommunication student at the University of Florida has brought me a vast array of knowledge about the modern world of communication. On their way out are newspapers and magazines, and in are online news websites, social media sites and blogs. Blogs can be both informative and entertaining, and oftentimes readers will follow bloggers throughout every entry. I have personally made my own blog, titled <a href="http://www.aseelalhomsi.wordpress.com">Through the Looking Glass</a>, in which I write about my on-going journey with weight-training, as well as my aspirations in the world of communication and my new-found interst in the field of physical therapy. </p>
