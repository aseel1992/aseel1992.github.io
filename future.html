                <h2>Graduation</h2>
                <p> In August of 2014, I will be graduating from the University of Florida with a Bachelor of Science in Telecommunication. I am looking forward to what the future beyond college holds. Throughout my time at UF, I have learned one extremely important and valuable lesson: to never give up. No matter how many obstacles get thrown in our direction, we must rise above them and learn from our experiences.</p>

               <p>Now that I will have a degree under my belt, I hope to do something that I have not been able to do since I have been in school: Travel. I have always wanted to sighsee and explore the world beyond my doorstep. I especially hope to travel to Europe and Australia, and maybe even complete graduate school abroad in England. Whatever it is that my future holds, I am waiting for it with open arms and excitement.</p>
